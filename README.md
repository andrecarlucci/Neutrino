Neutrino
========

This project is just in the beginning , but it will be really useful for you if you have this scenario:

- you want to store time series (date, time and a value)
- these series have a fixed interval (every 1s, every 5min, every 1h...)
- the values usually change from register to register (it doesn't store only the changes like other tsdbs)
- you want freaking awesome read and write speed, infinity scalability and probably the most efficent way to store the data

Sounds like something you would like to have? Help me build it.
